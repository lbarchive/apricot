=========================
Apricot theme for Pelican
=========================

*Apricot* is a centered, fixed width, and simple-looking theme, designed from
scratch for my personal blog, `Pointless Blog of Apricot`_.

It's not a fork of any themes, not even a copy-and-pasting, but I might have
checked up on the official simple theme, when I couldn't figure how what a
attribute is for. I wanted to release this theme in the public domain, so I
avoided others' code as best as I can.

Contributing

add stuff that I don't like to have on my blog, you would put me in rough spot.

So,

FAQ
===

Why is it called "Apricot?"
---------------------------

.. note::

   This is not asked yet, but I foresee some people would have this question.

The name is from the my blog's name, "Pointless Blog of Apricot."

Originally, I was going to name it that, but it really is too long, so I picked
the keyword -- or is it? -- "apricot" as the theme's name.

And I am sure you now would ask why "Pointless Blog of Apricot?" You will have
to read it on `Pointless Blog of Apricot`__.
